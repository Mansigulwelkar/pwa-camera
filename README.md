 You can also make adjustments to the camera settings while the camera is open, allowing you to get the perfect shot. 
Finally, when you’re ready to take the photo or video, simply press the capture button and the image will be saved to your device. With the Progressive Web Camera feature, taking photos and videos has never been easier.
 Additionally, you can switch between the front and rear cameras of your device with a single tap.
